  affiliations
- **Device Data**: Device identifiers are anonymized where possible
- **Data Retention**: Historical data is retained according to your company's
  policies
- **Data Access**: Only authorized users within your organization can access
  your data

### Data Segregation

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each company's data is completely isolated
- **Company-specific Access**: Users can only access devices and data within
  their organization
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different user roles have appropriate access
  levels

## Device Security

### Amazon Sidewalk Network Security

GridCube devices communicate over Amazon Sidewalk, which provides
enterprise-grade security:

  protocols
- **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require proper authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized

#### **Web Application Security**

- **Content Security Policy**: Web applications implement strict content
  security policies
- **Cross-Origin Protection**: CORS policies prevent unauthorized cross-origin
  requests
- **Session Security**: User sessions are managed securely with proper timeouts
- **XSS Protection**: Applications are protected against cross-site scripting
  attacks

### Network Access Controls

- **Firewall Protection**: All network traffic is filtered through security
  groups
- **DDoS Protection**: CloudFront provides DDoS protection for web applications
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Access can be restricted by geographic location
  if needed
- **IP Whitelisting**: API access can be restricted to specific IP ranges

## User Access Control

### Authentication System

GridCube uses AWS Cognito for secure user authentication:

#### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- **Email Verification**: All user accounts require email verification
- **Strong Passwords**: Password policies enforce strong, complex passwords
- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely with automatic
  timeouts
- **Account Lockout**: Failed login attempts result in temporary account
  lockouts

#### **Role-Based Access Control**

- **Company Administrators**: Full access to manage users, devices, and company
  settings
- **Device Managers**: Can manage devices and create events, but cannot manage
  users
- **Device Viewers**: Can view device data and create events, but cannot modify
  devices

### User Management

- **Company Isolation**: Users can only access data within their organization
- **Permission Auditing**: All user actions are logged for security auditing
- **Account Deactivation**: User accounts can be deactivated immediately when
  needed
- **Access Reviews**: Regular access reviews ensure appropriate permissions

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security Standards

GridCube infrastructure follows AWS security best practices:

#### **Compute Security**

- **Serverless Architecture**: Lambda functions provide secure, isolated
  execution environments
- **Runtime Security**: All code runs in secure, managed environments
- **Resource Isolation**: Each customer's data is processed in isolated
  environments
- **Automatic Scaling**: Infrastructure scales automatically while maintaining
  security

#### **Storage Security**

- **Encrypted Storage**: All data is stored in encrypted databases
- **Access Logging**: All database access is logged for security monitoring
- **Backup Security**: Regular backups are encrypted and stored securely
- **Data Redundancy**: Data is replicated across multiple availability zones
