## Amazon Sidewalk Integration

GridCube devices communicate over Amazon Sidewalk, a secure, low-bandwidth
network designed for IoT applications. This integration provides several key
security benefits:

### Network Security Features

#### **End-to-End Encryption**

- All device communications are encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- Messages are encrypted at the device level before transmission
- Decryption only occurs at authorized endpoints within the GridCube
  infrastructure

#### **Device Authentication**

- Each GridCube device has unique cryptographic certificates installed during
  manufacturing
- Certificates are used to authenticate all device communications
- Certificate validation prevents unauthorized device impersonation

#### **Message Integrity**

- All messages include cryptographic signatures to ensure authenticity
- Message integrity checks prevent tampering during transmission
- Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks

#### **Frequency Hopping**

- Communications use frequency hopping to prevent interference
- Dynamic frequency selection improves reliability and security
- Interference-resistant communication protocols

### Amazon Sidewalk Security Benefits

Reference:
[Amazon Sidewalk Security Whitepaper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GRGWE27XHZPRPBGX)

GridCube leverages Amazon Sidewalk's security features:

1. **Network-Level Security**
   - Encrypted communications using industry-standard protocols
   - Device authentication through cryptographic certificates
   - Message integrity verification
   - Frequency hopping for interference resistance

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - Minimal data collection by Amazon
   - Device data is only accessible to authorized GridCube services
   - No personal information is transmitted over Sidewalk

3. **Reliability & Coverage**
   - Redundant network infrastructure
   - Automatic failover mechanisms
   - Wide coverage area with minimal infrastructure requirements

## Device Security

### Manufacturing Security

GridCube devices are manufactured with security-first principles:

#### **Secure Provisioning**

- Each device receives unique cryptographic certificates during manufacturing
- Certificates are generated using secure hardware modules
- Device identifiers are cryptographically bound to certificates

#### **Firmware Security**

- Device firmware is cryptographically signed
- Secure boot processes verify firmware integrity
- Firmware updates require cryptographic verification

### Device Communication Security

#### **Message Authentication**

```
Device → Amazon Sidewalk → GridCube Infrastructure
   ↓           ↓                    ↓
Signed    Encrypted           Verified &
Message   Transmission       Authenticated
```

#### **Secure Message Flow**

1. Device creates message with device-specific signature
2. Message is encrypted using AES-256
3. Message is transmitted over Amazon Sidewalk
4. GridCube infrastructure receives and validates message
5. Message is decrypted and processed securely

### Device Management Security

- **Remote Monitoring**: Device health and status are monitored securely
- **Firmware Updates**: Updates are cryptographically signed and verified
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can control devices within their
  organization
- **Audit Logging**: All device interactions are logged for security auditing

## Network Security

### Cloud Infrastructure Security

GridCube runs on Amazon Web Services with enterprise-grade security:

#### **API Gateway Security**

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications use TLS 1.2+
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation with AWS Cognito
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas

#### **Lambda Function Security**

- **Isolated Execution**: Each function runs in isolated environments
- **Runtime Security**: Managed runtime environments with security updates
- **Resource Limits**: Timeout and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access to AWS resources

### Network Access Controls

#### **Firewall Protection**

- Security groups filter all network traffic
- Inbound traffic is restricted to necessary ports
- Outbound traffic is controlled and monitored

#### **DDoS Protection**

- CloudFront provides DDoS protection for web applications
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Geographic restrictions can be applied if needed

## Application Security

### Web Application Security

#### **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

```typescript
// Implemented CSP for GridCube web application
contentSecurityPolicy: {
    contentSecurityPolicy: "default-src 'self' https:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:; img-src 'self' data: https:;",
    override: true,
}
```

#### **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**

- Whitelist-based origin policy
- Environment-specific allowed origins
- Credential support for authenticated requests
- Preflight request caching

#### **Session Security**

- Secure session management with automatic timeouts
- HTTPS-only cookie transmission
- Session invalidation on logout
- Protection against session hijacking

### API Security

#### **Authentication & Authorization**

```typescript
// JWT token validation with AWS Cognito
export const auth: MiddlewareHandler = async (c: Context, next: Next) => {
    const token = authHeader.replace("Bearer ", "");
    const decodedToken = decode(token, { complete: true });

    // Verify with Cognito JWKs
    const pems = await getPems();
    const pem = pems[kid];

    verify(token, pem, {
        issuer: `https://cognito-idp.${region}.amazonaws.com/${userPoolId}`,
    });
};
```

#### **Input Validation**

```typescript
// Zod schema validation for all API inputs
const deviceIdSchema = z.union([
    z.string().uuid(),
    z.string().regex(/^\d{6}$/, "Device ID must be exactly 6 digits"),
]);

const eventRequestSchema = z.discriminatedUnion("event_type", [
    z.object({
        event_id: z.string(),
        event_type: z.literal(EventType.LOAD_UP),
        event_data: loadUpSchema,
    }),
    // ... other event types
]);
```

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

#### **Encryption at Rest**

- All DynamoDB tables are encrypted using AWS-managed keys
- S3 buckets use server-side encryption
- Lambda function environment variables are encrypted

#### **Encryption in Transit**

- All API communications use TLS 1.2+
- Device communications are encrypted over Amazon Sidewalk
- Database connections use encrypted connections

### Data Privacy

#### **Multi-tenant Architecture**

- Complete data isolation between companies
- Company-specific access controls
- Role-based permissions within organizations

#### **Data Minimization**

- Only necessary data is collected and stored
- Device identifiers are anonymized where possible
- Personal information is limited to email addresses

### Data Access Controls

#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

```typescript
export enum UserRole {
    COMPANY_ADMIN = "COMPANY_ADMIN",
    DEVICE_MANAGER = "DEVICE_MANAGER",
    DEVICE_VIEWER = "DEVICE_VIEWER",
}

export enum Action {
    READ_DEVICES = "read_devices",
    WRITE_DEVICES = "write_devices",
    DELETE_DEVICES = "delete_devices",
    // ... more actions
}
```

#### **Permission Enforcement**

- Middleware-based permission checking
- Company-scoped access controls
- Device-specific permissions
- Audit logging for all access
